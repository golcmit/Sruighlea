# C++ GUI Application Project: Sruighlea

## 1. Project Goal
To create a user-friendly desktop GUI application for managing the `FanacalCharacters.db` database, allowing for easy viewing, adding, and editing of character data.

## 2. Technology Stack
- **Language:** C++
- **GUI Framework:** Qt
- **Database:** SQLite (using the existing `FanacalCharacters.db`)

## 3. Core Features (Initial Prototype)
- **Character List View:** Display all characters from the database in a main table view, showing key information like name and house.
- **Search/Filter:** Implement a search bar to easily find characters by name.
- **Detailed View:** When a character is selected from the list, display all their detailed information (birthday, blood status, relationships, etc.) in a separate panel.
- **Add/Edit Functionality:** Include a button to "Add New Character" which will open a new window to input and save their information.

## 4. Visual Design & UX
The application will feature a clean, modern, and polished design using Qt's capabilities. The user interface will be intuitive, with a clear layout that is easy to navigate.

## 5. First Milestone
The initial goal is to build a prototype that can successfully:
1. Connect to the `FanacalCharacters.db` database.
2. Fetch and display the list of characters in the main window.
